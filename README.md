# Advanced Text Analysis Tool

The Advanced Text Analysis Tool is a powerful C# script that demonstrates various text analysis capabilities in a single file. It provides a comprehensive set of features to process and analyze text data efficiently.

## Features

2. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Calculates the frequency of each word in the text and displays the top 10 most frequent words.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Performs basic sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the text.
4. **Text Summarization**: Generates a concise summary of the input text using extractive summarization techniques.
5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and extracts named entities (e.g., person names, locations, organizations) from the text.
6. **Text Similarity**: Calculates the similarity between two text documents using techniques like cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity.
7. **Text Generation**: Generates new text based on the input text using basic text generation algorithms.
